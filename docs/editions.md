# How we create an edition #

## Background Principles ##
- diplomatic editions
- what is [XML and TEI](https://github.com/HCMID/plinius/blob/master/editions/bamberg/pliny.xml)?

## Procedures ##
1. locate your assigned section of the manuscript
2. transcribe the text in a plain text file (text edit or notepad are great!)
3. put your text in an [xml file](https://github.com/StephanieML/CSI-2018-Pliny/blob/master/docs/template.xml)
4. Add mark up for things like abbreviations and corrections (see example above under "What is XML and TEI?")
5. *IF YOU HAVE TIME*: mark up for text for things like [Personal Names](https://github.com/HCMID/plinius/blob/master/datasets/persons.cex), [Place Names](https://github.com/HCMID/plinius/blob/master/datasets/places.cex), and [Ethnic adjectives](https://github.com/HCMID/plinius/blob/master/datasets/ethnic.cex).
6. When you've finished today, submit your work [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sGYfsAFKvhhTJ4uk5hVxiN8Z0m7jLe8c?usp=sharing). Your work will become part of the Pliny Project Archive!

**NOTE: This is a very abbreviated version of the editing process to fit in the time constraints of this workshop. We will explain later some of the other things we do.**
