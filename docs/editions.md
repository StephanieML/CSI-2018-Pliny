# How we create an edition #

## Background Principles ##
- diplomatic editions
- what is URN?
- what is XML and TEI?

## Procedures ##
1. locate your assigned section of the manuscript
2. mark up your hardcopy of the text for differences between what is in the manuscript
3. put your text in an xml file
4. mark up for text for things like Personal Names, Place Names, abbreviations, corrections

**NOTE: This is a very abbreviated version of the editing process to fit in the time constraints of this workshop. We will explain later some of the other things we do.**
