# How do I bring this into my classroom? #

1. Introductory activities in which you look at paleography and slowly get used to how medieval scribes abbreviate. Here are some [sample activities](https://github.com/StephanieML/CAAS2017)
2. Find what works for your classroom. I've done manuscript editing as projects and mini-units. You know what kind of flexibility you have to supplement your curriculum.
3. Extracurricular activities. Holy Cross hosted a Hackathon in February. If you're interested in these kinds of events, [let us know](link!) and we'll be sure to update you.
