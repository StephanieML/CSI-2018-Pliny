# The Total Editing Process #

What you saw today was a fraction of what goes into an edition. When not constrained by time, here is what we do:

1. Create an index of citable images that link to the text we are editing through the use of URNs
2. Create a digital diplomatic edition (like what we did today)
3. Run a series of validation tests on our edition to ensure that we are adhering to our editorial standards

## Why do we do this?
1. Creating an edition in this structure makes it easier for us to validate and verify our work
2. A citable, navigable edition allows us to generate and answer new research questions about the text. See some examples of what the Pliny team has been working on [here](https://hcmid.github.io/plinius/)
